# Simple Calculator

This project is a **Simple Calculator** implemented in Python. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## How to Use
1. Run the program in your Python environment.
2. Select an operation by entering the corresponding number:
   - `1` for Addition
   - `2` for Subtraction
   - `3` for Multiplication
   - `4` for Division
   - `5` to Exit the program
3. Enter two numbers when prompted.
4. The result will be displayed, or an error message will appear if the input is invalid (e.g., dividing by zero).
5. Repeat or exit the program.

## Features
- User-friendly text-based interface.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-numeric inputs or division by zero).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the Project
To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal or IDE:

```bash
python simple_calculator.py
```

## Future Improvements
- Add support for additional operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Add unit tests for better code reliability.
